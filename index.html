  <h1>The True Researcher Manifesto (v0.1.0)</h1>
  <p>
    Corruption is everywhere. Corruption in academia is a critical threat like the sword of Damocles, jeopardizing
    every single researcher.
  </p>
  <p>
    A corrupted researcher gives up seeking the truth. Rather, they prioritize earning money or fame. Just like drug
    addiction, once a researcher embarks on the intoxicating corruption, they are unlikely to go back. When this group
    of people grows to fill up a large proportion of academia and become the mainstream, they have the power to
    marginalize and evict honest researchers. It then ends up with all researchers on Earth, either voluntarily or
    being forced to, more or less participating in the collusion to gain private interests with misrepresented research
    outputs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the hope of preventing a dark future, True Researcher Group makes the following commitments:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A paper with one of its corresponding authors or its first author (except when authors are listed in alphabetical
      order) as a member of the True Researcher Group is an original work with accurate data, without any intentionally
      false statements.
    </li>
  </ul>
